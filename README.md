Ok, here we go:
First, locate the website, then start clicking.
Bear with me, the notifications only become more rare, so enjoy them while you can.
As you obtain more signals by clicking (I know the animations are cool), you can purchase multiplier upgrades from the shop.
At some point, you may find yourself in a tough spot on this journey to complete this endless game, which is why the bank exists.
Navigate to the bank tab to borrow signals in the form of a loan.
To do so, please select either Loan 1 or Loan 2 (it doesn't matter), then select the loan amount and time in which you will pay it off.
This subsequently changes the amount of interest you owe, therefore when the time runs out, the bank will take that many signals away from you.
See how far you can get with rising prices and inflation in this economy.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
